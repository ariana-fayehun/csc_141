The online documentation can be used to learn and check your code tomake sure that you are doing
everything right. It is the first thing I should check for definitive information about what I want to 
code.

The language reference can be referenced for a complete explanation of Python's syntax and the ActiveState
Python Cookbook can show common recipes and patterns that programmers often use when they code.

All of the above mentioned resources, along with many other resources, can be used to help me code 
effectively.
