# No Errors
print("Hello Python World!")

# Typo that causes an error

prignt("Hello Python World!")

# This causes an error because the word "print" is misspelled and Python cannot determine what it means
# To fix the error, I have to remove the "g".


# Another typo that causes an error

print "Hello Python World!"

# In this example, the error occurs because there are no parantheses surrounding the text string.
# To fix this error, I have to add the parantheses around the text string


# A typo that does NOT cause an error

print("Hello Ptython World!")

# This typo does NOT cause an error because it takes place within the parantheses.
# This means that Python reads it as a string, or a line of text to be printed out.
