I don't have much programming experience. I used Unity a little but stopped because I didn't know how to
code in the required language.

I've made two unfinished visual novels in Renpy which is implemented in Python but Python is not 
required in order to make a visual novel. Renpy has its own coding language that is simple and very easy
to use. That's what I have experience in. I've done very little python coding in Renpy.

Additionally, I took a CS course and a Game Design course at my high school where we did coding in
Scratch and Khan Academy. Those courses weren't very good, so I wouldn't consider it to be any kind of 
real programming experience.

Either way, these experiences have taught me the very basics of programming and how it works which 
I believe will help me to better understand this course and how to complete the assignments.


In the future, I hope to make several large RPGs. However, I tend to dream too big, which is why
my two visual novels are unfinished. So I want to start out with even smaller porjects in hopes of
actually finishing one.

I started out with visual novels because they are the easiest kind of games to make, especially
with my prior experience with drawing and writing. But I believe my skills are beyond that now
as I am bored of visual novels. I need something more challenging, so I'm hoping to move on to
some short RPGs.
