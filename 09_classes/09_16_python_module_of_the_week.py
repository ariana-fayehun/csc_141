# I read about importlib

# The importlib module in Python provides the functionality for importing 
# modules and packages dynamically, allowing for greater flexibility when the 
# module names are not known at coding time. It includes high-level APIs for 
# loading modules, checking for supported module types based on the platform, 
# and handling errors related to module imports, making it useful for 
# applications that require dynamic plugin systems or extensions.
